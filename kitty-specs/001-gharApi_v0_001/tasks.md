## Task Workflow

1. Tasks start in `planned/`
2. Move to `doing/` when work begins
3. Move to `for_review/` when implementation is complete
4. Move to `done/` after review and approval

## Task File Format

Each task is a markdown file with:

- **Status**: Current task status
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Requirements**: Detailed requirements
- **Implementation**: What was done/how to do it
- **Files**: Affected files
- **Testing**: How to test/verify
- **Acceptance Criteria**: When the task is complete

## Next Steps

- Review tasks in `for_review/` and move approved ones to `done/`
- All planned tasks have been implemented and moved to review
- Monitor for any additional tasks that may arise
